Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` file for your Python project. I've included sections for both the simple text editor project and the `MyCalendarTwo` calendar project described above. --- # Simple Text Editor A simple text editor application written in Python that allows users to create, edit, and save text files. It offers basic text manipulation functionality, providing a lightweight alternative to standard text editors. ## Features - Open and edit existing text files. - Create new text files. - Save changes to a file. - User-friendly interface with basic text operations. ## Requirements - Python 3.x - `tkinter` (GUI library for Python) ## How to Run 1. Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine: ```bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-editor-python.git ``` 2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. 3. Install required dependencies (if necessary): ```bash pip install tk ``` 4. Run the Python script: ```bash python text_editor.py ``` ## Usage - Open the application. - Use the menu options to open an existing text file, create a new file, or save your work. ---
